Currently, gems are assigned randomly to each biome in the overworld, but multi-gem ore is spawned in the Nether and The End. The randomness is seeded with your PC username (this is not collected or stored, the mod just calculates a hash code from the value). Glowroses spawning in the overworld will match gems that spawn in that biome."
