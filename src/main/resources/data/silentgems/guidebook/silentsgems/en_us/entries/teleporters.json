These teleporters are somewhat 'dumb'. They don't actually care if another teleporter exists at the destination, but you need two teleporters to set the destination. Recipes can be disabled in the config file."

Note that there are no actual 'links' between the teleporters. The linker merely tells the teleporters where to send things. Try using anchors to establish one-way connections."

They can also teleport non-player entities!$(li)Anchors - Not capable of teleporting anything, but the other teleporter types and return home charms can link to it. Also much cheaper!"
