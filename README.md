# Silent's Gems

The first Minecraft mod I ever released. Adds a lot of random things, most notably a tool and armor system in Minecraft 1.12.2 and lower. See [Silent Gear](https://github.com/SilentChaos512/Silent-Gear) if you want tools and armor in later versions.

Other features include teleporters, an alternative to enchanting, and a magic system I will probably never completely finish. Check the [CurseForge page](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/silents-gems) for details, I update it somewhat regularly and it details most features. Screenshots are out-of-date, so many things will look different in-game.

Only recent Minecraft versions are actively support, and only the latest version will receive new features in most cases. Older version will receive fixes for serious bugs only.

In Minecraft 1.17, the mod as it is now will be split into two mods, Silent's Gems: Base and Chaos. The number of gems will be drastically reduced so that more attention can be given to each one. The mod version number will change to 4.x.

- Silent's Gems: Base - This mod will contain gems, ores, common blocks and items, and gear materials. It will use the existing Curseforge project page.

- Silent's Gems: Chaos - This mod will contain chaos mechanics, chaos-related blocks and items, and the more overpowered features. Buggier, less stable features will also be moved here.

#### Major Versions

Major version updates intentionally break compatibility with older versions to rework and improve the mod. They only occur across some Minecraft updates.

- 4.x - Minecraft 1.17.x (early rework branch is 1.16.x)
- 3.x - Minecraft 1.13 to 1.16.x
- 2.x - Older than dinosaurs (1.9 - 1.12.2)
- 1.x - Older than dirt (1.6 - 1.8.9)

### Note on Downloads

**I only upload builds to Minecraft CurseForge.** If you downloaded the mod from somewhere other than Curse/CurseForge or their launcher (or as part of a modpack in some cases), I cannot make any guarantees about the file or its contents, as it was uploaded without my permission.
